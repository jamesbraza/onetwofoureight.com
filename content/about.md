I am inspired by philosophically-driven websites like
[martinFowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/),
[Lethain](https://lethain.com/), and
[Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/).

This website was created to inspire similar individuals filled with tenacity.

## Origin of 1248

1248 is an abstract sequence of digits starting with the unit number
that progressively doubles each digit.
The exponential nature of the sequence paired
with its simplicity makes 1248 thought-provoking.
It plays with the idea of connecting the creative right brain
with the logical left brain,
as the text "one two four eight" mirrors the concrete digits 1248.

How should one say 1248?
Think: Buzz Lightyear's pronunciation of "to infinity" from
[his quote](https://youtu.be/sEQoOjj7j4o) "to infinity and beyond!"
