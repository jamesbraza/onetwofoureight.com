These days I find my hands on a keyboard more than anything else,
my eyes riveted to a twilight screen,
and my skin untouched from the sun.
The following is a reflection from the past to the present,
starting when my software journey had just begun.

I entered software when I left behind manufacturing automation,
and envisioned myself as a **hacker**.
Code pieced together quickly,
and I loved connecting dots.
Parachuting into challenges, and armed with Stack Overflow,
I charged the green field.
I didn't know what a unit test was,
but with enough iteration and grit,
the code would always run.

One and a half years later,
the depth and breadth of my thought had expanded.
I've heard chess grandmasters ponder over twenty moves ahead;
I too started thinking deeper.
The more code I read, the faster my comprehension.
Project after project, I witnessed the impact of my decisions.
I came to have confidence when informing my peers
"I am a **software engineer**."
Fascinated by design patterns, I tweaked my approach
with every implementation.
I took pride in this compliment:
the software works because it must work.

With the passing of another two years,
I entered a new era, one of minimalism.
The docstrings I once cared for began to seem ugly,
the classes felt cumbersome.
I ran into too many typing limitations,
and finally admired duck typing.
If the code didn't feel lightweight,
I would restlessly envision solutions at night.
I would not say I was implementing faster,
but I definitely felt I was implementing _better_.
Attending PyCon for the first time,
I realized how far I had come, and glimpsed the road ahead.
I now considered myself a **senior software engineer**,
though in actuality the corresponding promotion was premature.

Over four years into work as a software professional,
my beliefs became fuzzy, more philosophical.
The meditative article [The story of Mel][1] was impactful to me.
Taking place around me was a decline in the global economy,
and the sun set on my program of the last three years.
The code I'd spent thousands of hours forming went unrealized.
After much reflection,
I can state our misgivings were
mostly beyond the technology under development;
building well is only part the battle.

Ascending the Dunning-Kruger effect's slope of enlightenment,
a fourth shift in identity took place: I was a **programmer**.
I appreciated a saying reminiscent of the Zen of Python:
"done is better than perfect."
The tech stack didn't matter so much any more,
developed instincts guided me.
I finally embraced `vim`, revisiting my fundamentals.
I knew the way things could be,
though I'd still get hung up on how they should be.
Ironically, this mindset was not far from my starting headspace years ago.

I am reminded of a Dr. Seuss title "Oh, the Places You'll Go!"
To think software is just one of many subsets of computer science,
I'm so glad I got out of mechanical engineering.
